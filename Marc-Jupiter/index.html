          <h1>Jupiter</h1>
          <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.</p>

        <p>On December 21, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn met in a "great conjunction," the closest they could be seen in the sky together for nearly 800 years. A conjunction occurs when two or more planets line up exactly, and when Jupiter and Saturn align, their vibrations blend and work together. Jupiter is particularly bright, appearing as a brilliant point of white light in the sky, while Saturn is a fainter dull white object, yet still about as bright as a typical bright star. Great conjunctions occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter "overtakes" Saturn in its orbit. They are named "great" because they are by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets (excluding Uranus and Neptune). As successive great conjunctions occur nearly 120Â° apart, their appearances form a triangular pattern, and every third conjunction returns after some 60 years to the vicinity of the first.</p>

            <p>Planet Saturn Overview Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's.
            3 days ago - Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
