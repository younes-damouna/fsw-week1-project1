            <h2> The sun</h2>
            <p> The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system, with a distance of 695,508 kilometres from centre to
                surface.
                It contains 99.86% of the mass of the entire solar system and could contain roughly 1.3 million
                Earths.The Sun
                is an average-sized star. Some stars are just a tenth of its size, while others are more than 700 times
                bigger.
                Due to its huge mass and strong gravity, the Sun is a near perfect sphere.The core is the hottest part
                of the Sun
                , at 15 million degrees Celsius. This is hot enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion, when hydrogen atoms
                are fused
                together to form larger helium atoms. This releases an extraordinary amount of energy which in turn is
                released as
                heat and light. The energy produced at the core takes up to a million years to reach the outer layer
                known as the
                convective zone. At this point the temperature drops to around two million degrees Celsius. By the time
                it gets to
                the surface the temperature is down to a much cooler 5,973°C - but it's still hot enough to boil
                diamonds.
                In the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, the temperature begins to rise again to roughly two
                million degrees Celsius. As distance from the core of the Sun grows wider, the temperature would be
                expected to drop. This dramatic increase in temperature in the atmosphere is one of the star's biggest
                mysteries.

            <h2> Mercury</h2>
            <p> Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It is a terrestrial planet,
                meaning it is made
                of rock and metal like Earth. Mercury is also the fastest planet, orbiting the Sun once every 88 Earth
                days.
                Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, similar to the Moon. This is because Mercury has no atmosphere
                to protect
                it from impacts. Mercury also has a very thin exosphere, which is made up of hydrogen, helium, and
                oxygen atoms.
                Mercury's extreme temperature variations are one of its most notable features. The side of Mercury
                facing the Sun
                can reach temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), while the side facing away
                from the
                Sun can get as cold as -300 degrees Fahrenheit (-184 degrees Celsius) Mercury has no natural satellites
                and no rings.
                It is also the densest planet in our solar system, with a density of 5.43 grams per cubic centimeter.
                This is because
                Mercury has a large metallic core, which makes up about 70% of its mass.

            <p class="planet-description">
                Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar
                System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the
                mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically
                smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
                atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The
                planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5
                billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea, representing
                Neptune's trident.

            <p class="planet-description">
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the
                planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy
                is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has
                the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has
                a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84
                Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight,
                followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

                <p class="planet-description">
                    A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light
                    and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.[2] The theory of general
                    relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black
                    hole.The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great
                    effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable
                    features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black
                    body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts
                    that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a
                    temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths
                    of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
