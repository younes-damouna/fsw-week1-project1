                <p class="planet-description">
                    Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar
                    System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the
                    mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically
                    smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
                    atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The
                    planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5
                    billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea, representing
                    Neptune's trident.

                <p class="planet-description">
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the
                    planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy
                    is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has
                    the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has
                    a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84
                    Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight,
                    followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

                    <p class="planet-description">
                        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light
                        and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.[2] The theory of general
                        relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black
                        hole.The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great
                        effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable
                        features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black
                        body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts
                        that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a
                        temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths
                        of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
