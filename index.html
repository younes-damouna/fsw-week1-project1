            <p class="nisreen-text">The solar system is a fascinating and intricate celestial arrangement
                that consists of the sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and
                various other celestial objects. At the heart of our solar system is
                the sun, a massive, blazing star that provides the energy and warmth
                necessary for life on Earth. Orbiting around the sun are eight planets,
                including Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
                Each planet has its own unique characteristics and plays a vital role in
                the dynamics of the solar system.

            <p class="nisreen-text">Space, the vast and mysterious expanse that extends beyond Earth's atmosphere,
                has long been a subject of fascination and wonder for humanity. It represents
                the final frontier, a realm where the laws of physics and the boundaries of
                human knowledge are continually tested. In the emptiness of space, there is no
                atmosphere, no sound, and no up or down. It is a place of extreme temperatures,
                from the scorching heat of the sun to the frigid cold of deep space. The study of
                space, known as astronomy, has deepened our understanding of the cosmos and our
                place within it. It has sparked philosophical questions about the origins of the
                universe, the existence of extraterrestrial life, and the nature of black holes
                and dark matter.

            <p class="nisreen-text">Astrology, the age-old study of the stars and their influence on human life,
                has captivated civilizations for centuries. In astrology, the positions and
                movements of celestial bodies, especially planets, are believed to shape our
                personalities, destinies, and even our daily lives. Each planet in our solar
                system is associated with unique qualities and characteristics, and astrologers
                use these planetary influences to create birth charts and horoscopes. Whether
                you're a believer or a skeptic, the fascination with how the planets align and
                impact our earthly existence is a testament to our enduring curiosity about the
                cosmos. As we gaze at the night sky and ponder the mysteries of the universe,
                we find a connection between the celestial and the terrestrial, a reminder that
                we are part of a grand cosmic dance.

            <h2> The sun</h2>
            <p> The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system, with a distance of 695,508 kilometres from centre to
                surface.
                It contains 99.86% of the mass of the entire solar system and could contain roughly 1.3 million
                Earths.The Sun
                is an average-sized star. Some stars are just a tenth of its size, while others are more than 700 times
                bigger.
                Due to its huge mass and strong gravity, the Sun is a near perfect sphere.The core is the hottest part
                of the Sun
                , at 15 million degrees Celsius. This is hot enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion, when hydrogen atoms
                are fused
                together to form larger helium atoms. This releases an extraordinary amount of energy which in turn is
                released as
                heat and light. The energy produced at the core takes up to a million years to reach the outer layer
                known as the
                convective zone. At this point the temperature drops to around two million degrees Celsius. By the time
                it gets to
                the surface the temperature is down to a much cooler 5,973°C - but it's still hot enough to boil
                diamonds.
                In the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, the temperature begins to rise again to roughly two
                million degrees Celsius. As distance from the core of the Sun grows wider, the temperature would be
                expected to drop. This dramatic increase in temperature in the atmosphere is one of the star's biggest
                mysteries.

            <h2> Mercury</h2>
            <p> Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It is a terrestrial planet,
                meaning it is made
                of rock and metal like Earth. Mercury is also the fastest planet, orbiting the Sun once every 88 Earth
                days.
                Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, similar to the Moon. This is because Mercury has no atmosphere
                to protect
                it from impacts. Mercury also has a very thin exosphere, which is made up of hydrogen, helium, and
                oxygen atoms.
                Mercury's extreme temperature variations are one of its most notable features. The side of Mercury
                facing the Sun
                can reach temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), while the side facing away
                from the
                Sun can get as cold as -300 degrees Fahrenheit (-184 degrees Celsius) Mercury has no natural satellites
                and no rings.
                It is also the densest planet in our solar system, with a density of 5.43 grams per cubic centimeter.
                This is because
                Mercury has a large metallic core, which makes up about 70% of its mass.

                        observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman

                <p>On December 21, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn met in a "great conjunction," the closest they could be seen
                    in the sky together for nearly 800 years. A conjunction occurs when two or more planets line up
                    exactly, and when Jupiter and Saturn align, their vibrations blend and work together. Jupiter is
                    particularly bright, appearing as a brilliant point of white light in the sky, while Saturn is a
                    fainter dull white object, yet still about as bright as a typical bright star. Great conjunctions
                    occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter "overtakes" Saturn in its orbit. They are named
                    "great" because they are by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets (excluding
                    Uranus and Neptune). As successive great conjunctions occur nearly 120° apart, their appearances
                    form a triangular pattern, and every third conjunction returns after some 60 years to the vicinity
                    of the first.</p>

                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the
                    planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy
                    is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has
                    the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has
                    a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84
                    Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight,
                    followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

                    mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically
                    smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
                    atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The

                        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light
                        and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.[2] The theory of general
                        relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black
                        hole.The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great
                        effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable
                        features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black
                        body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts
                        that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a
                        temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths
                        of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
