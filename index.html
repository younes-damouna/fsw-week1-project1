        <h2> The sun</h2>
        <p> The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system, with a distance of 695,508 kilometres from centre to surface.
             It contains 99.86% of the mass of the entire solar system and could contain roughly 1.3 million Earths.The Sun 
             is an average-sized star. Some stars are just a tenth of its size, while others are more than 700 times bigger.
              Due to its huge mass and strong gravity, the Sun is a near perfect sphere.The core is the hottest part of the Sun
              , at 15 million degrees Celsius. This is hot enough to sustain thermonuclear fusion, when hydrogen atoms are fused
               together to form larger helium atoms. This releases an extraordinary amount of energy which in turn is released as
                heat and light. The energy produced at the core takes up to a million years to reach the outer layer known as the 
                convective zone. At this point the temperature drops to around two million degrees Celsius. By the time it gets to 
                the surface the temperature is down to a much cooler 5,973Â°C - but it's still hot enough to boil diamonds.              
              In the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, the temperature begins to rise again to roughly two million degrees Celsius. As distance from the core of the Sun grows wider, the temperature would be expected to drop. This dramatic increase in temperature in the atmosphere is one of the star's biggest mysteries.

                <h2> Mercury</h2>
                <p> Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It is a terrestrial planet, meaning it is made
                     of rock and metal like Earth. Mercury is also the fastest planet, orbiting the Sun once every 88 Earth days.
                    Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, similar to the Moon. This is because Mercury has no atmosphere to protect
                     it from impacts. Mercury also has a very thin exosphere, which is made up of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen atoms.                
                    Mercury's extreme temperature variations are one of its most notable features. The side of Mercury facing the Sun
                     can reach temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), while the side facing away from the
                      Sun can get as cold as -300 degrees Fahrenheit (-184 degrees Celsius) Mercury has no natural satellites and no rings.
                       It is also the densest planet in our solar system, with a density of 5.43 grams per cubic centimeter. This is because 
                       Mercury has a large metallic core, which makes up about 70% of its mass.
